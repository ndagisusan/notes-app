      <h1>DevOps</h1>
      <p>
        The abbreviation "DevOps" refers to the replacement of segregated
        Development and Operations. The goal is to form multidisciplinary teams
        that collaborate using common, efficient procedures and technologies.
        Agile planning, continuous integration, continuous delivery, and
        application monitoring are all important DevOps strategies. DevOps is a
        never-ending journey.
